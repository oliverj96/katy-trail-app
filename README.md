# Katy Trail App

In effort of preserving the Katy Trail history, we have developed this app that will inform users of historical sites on the trail when approaching specific areas. Users can also read about the locations from the app itself.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to build the project so it can be published onto the Google Play Store or Apple App Store.

### Hardware Requirements

If you plan to run this app on a real mobile device, here are the hardware requirements:
- iPhone running iOS 10 or later
- Android 4.0 or later

### Prerequisites

An installation of the Flutter framework and Dart SDK is required. Instructions to installing Flutter can be found [here](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).

To test the app on Android, you must also install the Android SDK and Android Studio. Installing Android Studio should also install the Android SDK, which you can find the installer [here](https://developer.android.com/studio).

> Note: If your computer is using a Ryzen AMD processor and you wish to use an emulator, you must download the Beta version of Android Studio instead which can be found [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/preview).

If you wish to test the app on iOS, you'll need to install Xcode from the App Store.

### Installing

Clone or download the repository onto your local hard drive. You may download the repo as a .zip file from the download button above, or use this command onto your bash terminal or git bash:
```
git clone https://github.com/oliverj96/katy_trail_app
```
Once the repo is downloaded, launch the terminal (on MacOS or Linux) or command prompt (on Windows) and navigate to that directory.

Next, install the app's dependencies by running:
```
flutter pub get
```

## Running the tests

```
flutter run
```
In the root directory of the repository.

## Usage

A user must tap the app icon on their phone's home screen to open the app. 
The app opens to a home page with three navigation options: Map, Explore, and About. 
There is also a bookmark icon on the blue title bar in the upper-right hand corner that leads to a bookmark page.

**Map Page**
- Shows map of St. Charles with red location icons at different points on the Katy Trail
- Ability to zoom in and out on map by pinching together two fingers or spreading two fingers apart on phone screen
- Ability to move around on map by placing a finger on phone screen and swiping in any direction
- Tapping a red location pops up a location card with that specific location's name, a short description, and two side-by-side texts that say "Learn" and "Bookmark"
- Tapping "Learn" on a location card navigates to a page with that location's name on the top blue title bar, one or more images of the location, and a historical description of the location
- Tapping "Bookmark" moves the location data (location name, image/s, and description) to the user's bookmarks and changes "Bookmark" to "Remove"
- Tapping "Remove" removes the location data from the user's bookmarks and changes "Remove" to "Bookmark"
- Tapping anywhere outside the location card makes the location card disappear
- Tapping the bookmarks icon on the blue title bar in the upper-right hand corner navigates to the bookmark page

**Explore Page**
- Shows all locations on the Katy Trail that have been added to the app; each location appears on a separate card with the location's name, a short description, and two side-by-side texts that say "Learn" and "Bookmark"
- Ability to scroll up and down by swiping a finger up and down on phone's screen
- Tapping "Learn" on a location card navigates to a page with that location's name on the top blue title bar, one or more images of the location, and a historical description of the location
- Tapping "Bookmark" moves the location data (location name, image/s, and description) to the user's bookmarks and changes "Bookmark" to "Remove"
- Tapping "Remove" removes the location data from the user's bookmarks and changes "Remove" to "Bookmark"
- Tapping the bookmarks icon on the blue title bar in the upper-right hand corner navigates to the bookmark page

**About Page**

- Has a brief welcome message and summary of the app
- Tapping the bookmarks icon on the blue title bar in the upper-right hand corner navigates to the bookmark page

**Bookmark Page**
- Shows all locations that user has bookmarked on separate cards with the location's name, a short description, and two side-by-side texts that say "Learn" and "Remove"
- Ability to scroll up and down by swiping a finger up and down on phone's screen (given that there are enough bookmarked locations to scroll down)
- Tapping "Learn" on a location card navigates to a page with that location's name on the top blue title bar, one or more images of the location, and a historical description of the location
- Tapping "Remove" removes the location data from the bookmarks page so the location card disappears
